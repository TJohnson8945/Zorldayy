# Zorlday
This game was created by my team as our first team game required for Game Design 1 at Jacksonville State University. 
We decided to reuse the original Legend of Zelda sprites in order to save time. We had three weeks to complete the assignment.
We had wanted to incorporate A* enemy pathfinding and tilebased collision. So we spent most of our efforts working out the
kinks.

## Getting Started
This game was created using GameMaker Studio 2, and runs in said program.

## Explaining the Game

### Ganmplay
The game follows a very similar style to the original Legend of Zelda. The difference being that we had a three week time limit to complete so we designed our own over world and dungeon. The player has health that is in two parts. Some damage will take half a heart. The objective is to collect the three keys in the dungeons to get upgraded weapons, and the boss key which are in the over world. Once you have collected the boss key, head to the boss and defeat them. It will drop a "Trophy" that needs to be taken to the over world in order to win the game.

### Enemies
The enemies all have no attacks or animations due to time constraints, but they do have differing health and speed.

### The Boss
The boss has his own attack pattern. In which it shoots homing projectiles at the character. After dealing enough damage, the boss dies and drops the trophy.

### Secrets
There is a hidden secret in the spawn room in the over world. I will leave that up to you.

## Purpose
The intent of making this game was to test our ability to work as a team. We worked as efficiently as possible given the time constraint. I am proud of what we accomplished and learned a great deal from this assignment. There will be two more game assignments in this class and I can not wait to see where I go.
