# Introduction
This game was created by my team as our first team game required for Game Design 1 at Jacksonville State University. 
We decided to reuse the original Legend of Zelda sprites in order to save time. We had three weeks to complete the assignment.
We had wanted to incorporate A* enemy pathfinding and tilebased collision. So we spent most of our efforts working out the
kinks.
